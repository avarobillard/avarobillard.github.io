Between February 13-17, 2021, Texas experienced a power crisis due to a severe winter storm named Uri. The increased demand for electricity for heating strained the Texas power grid and caused the implementation of rolling blackouts, leading to extended power outages for many [@ZHOU2024104339]. The Texas power grid is managed by the Electrical Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOCT) and operates independently, not connected to other states' power grids or able to borrow from them in a crisis [@Monahanetal2024]. As a result of this storm, at least 246 people died and $195 billion dollars worth of damage were caused [@ZHOU2024104339]. By understanding how this impact of losing power was felt across the Houston community, we can allocate resources and plan more strategically for future weather events.\n\n**Objective**: Throughout this blog, we will use VIIRS, OpenStreetMap, and U.S. Census data to visualize the impacts of the winter storms by estimating the number of homes in the Houston metropolitan area that lost power and combine this with socioeconomic data about median household income to investigate whether these impacts were disproportionately felt.\n\n### Load packages\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(stars)\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(terra)\nlibrary(tmap)\nlibrary(testthat)\nlibrary(scales)\n```\n:::\n\n## 1.

Find locations that experienced a blackout\n\nTo identify places that experienced a blackout, a mask was created to indicate for each cell whether or not it experienced a blackout. The threshold for this mask was a drop of more than 200 nW cm-2sr-1 between the pre and post storm night light rasters. This blackout mask was then vectorized.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\n# Find the change in night lights intensity pre and post storm\nlight_difference <- lights_2021_02_07 - lights_2021_02_16\n\n# Assign NA to cells that experienced a change less than 200 nW cm-2sr-1\nlight_difference[light_difference < 200] <- NA\n\n# Vectorize the blackout mask and fix invalid geometries\nlight_diff_vec <- light_difference %>% \n  st_as_sf() %>% \n  st_transform(3083)\n\n# Test for valid geometry\nexpect_false(any(!st_is_valid(light_diff_vec)))\n```\n:::\n\n\n## 3.

An additional column was added to retain this information, where `TRUE` corresponds to a tract that had homes that experienced a blackout and `FALSE` corresponds to those that did not.

Based upon the map, many of the census tracts that were affected are located in the metropolitan areas of Houston possibly due to the power grid there being more interconnected. That might have an effect on the income distributions if people living in urban areas have more varied incomes. One study limitation might have been how the blackouts were accounted for, as we don't know for certain that these light differences were due to the storms and not other factors such as day of the week or not having as much activity in the city due to the severe weather conditions.\n\nFor further analysis, I would like to conduct the same analysis for rural Texas areas, and include additional time points to see how long different communities were without power. As a native Texan, I experienced this storm from Austin. The impacts were certainly felt across the state, and we experienced prolonged time without power. This crisis was also coming right after the COVID-19 pandemic, which also had extremely disproportionate impacts on marginalized communities in Texas [@Ura2021]. ",
