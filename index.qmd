Hi! I'm Ava Robillard, and I am an early career data scientist. My background is in plant science and I am passionate about expanding this subject area to broader issues in sustainability with creative as well as organized data science approaches. When Iâ€™m not busy coding, you can usually find me out hiking, running, or reading.
